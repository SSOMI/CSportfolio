<h1> About Me </h1>
  
  <p> Computer science is super interesting, prior to this class i had worked on scratch and learned some of the language 
    python. I was excited about making a website this summer and learning how to add some photos since i enjoy photogrophy. 
    i chose to enroll in this class to learn more about computers and computer science. </p>
