         <p>The data project problem I chose was high electricity bills in the winter. As you can see on the bar graph when the
                  temperature is lower the electricity used is higher. My target audience for this problem if people
                 paying theit electricity bill. Some of the information could be flawed because of windchill or just 
                 being cold even in warm weather. We might have varying winters as well.I got this information from multiple
                 electricity bills. The lower temprstures are when you want to 
                 conserve heat. A recomentdation to help decrease the amount used is lower the
                  heat at night and use more blankets in the winter.</p>
